# Pokémon Simulations

Modeled after the Pokémon franchise's computational methods, these programs simulate three key features of the original games: battling, catching Pokémon, and calculating stats. Written as a personal project in Summer 2020.

### Compile & Run
* Compile programs using clang++ -Wall -Wextra

* Compile program using "make"
* Run with executable: ./gerp \<directoryToIndex\> \<outputFile\>
  * directoryToIndex: starting directory that will be traversed and indexed, and is a full path name (example: /home/ehom/comp15).
  * outputFile: file name that query results will be printed to.
